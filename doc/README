The API documentation is in squonk.md

to run as a command, try:
  python squonk.py -h

the examples can be run using a command like:
  python squonk.py -r yaml/pipelines.rdkit.sucos.o3da.yaml -d -o outdir
from the pysquonk directory, where outdir is the directory where the job output
should go. This assumes that config.ini has been editted with your username 
and password.

The documentation was created by running:
  pdoc squonk.py -o doc --force

from the top level directory
